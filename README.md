class MyCustomComponent(BaseComponent):
    supports_gpu = True  # Set to True if GPU acceleration is supported
    
    def __init__(self, name="MyComponent", gpu_config=None):
        super().__init__(name=name, gpu_config=gpu_config)
        
    def run(self):
        while self.running:
            # Component logic here
            self.logger.info("Component running")
            time.sleep(1)
```

Then add your component to the `system_config.json` file:

```json
{
  "components": [
    // ... existing components
    {"name": "My Custom Component", "module": "path.to.my_module", "class": "MyCustomComponent", "enabled": true}
  ]

2. **Component Initialization Failure**
   - Check system logs at `system.log`
   - Verify that all dependencies are installed
   - Ensure component module and class names are correct in configuration

3. **Dashboard Not Accessible**
   - Verify that Flask is installed
   - Check if dashboard is running on a different port
   - Ensure firewall settings allow access to the port

### Logging

System logs are stored in the `system.log` file. To increase log verbosity, modify the `log_level` in `system_config.json`:

```json
{
  "system_settings": {
    "log_level": "DEBUG"
  }
}
```
